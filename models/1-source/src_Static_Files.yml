# src is a reference to a table that exist in the DWH
# the source table is holds raw data that didn't go through cleansing
# src.yml should include: tests, documentation, & definitions

# possible tests -
    # unique: the order_id column in the orders model should be unique
    # not_null: the order_id column in the orders model should not contain null values
    # accepted_values: the status column in the orders should be one of 'placed', 'shipped', 'completed', or 'returned'
    # relationships: each customer_id in the orders model exists as an id in the customers table (also known as referential integrity)
